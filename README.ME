Implementation of a multimodal recommendation model uses unstructured text data, structured data,
 and image data from the movies poster to provide recommendations. 
 This is based on the architecture described in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09157 
 And using the data provided for the paper to train/develop it 

 There are no complete results that are discussed as the model is still training on my local device
